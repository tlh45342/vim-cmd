This is NOT anything to do with VMWARE.

This is an indepdent project that has goals that are presented by the name.  Virtual-Infrastructure-Manager a straightforward derived name for a straightforward and common purpose.

hostd is meant to be a CPU emulator server.

EVERYTHING HERE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS
